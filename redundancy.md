# Redundancy through tests

Repeating yourself is not always a bad thing.

When you do something twice, you are less likeky to do it wrong.
Modifying any of the two sould be catched through automated tests.

What's the secret ? Tying these occurences together, but not too closely.

It's even better if two different people write each occurence.

Doing more than two starts being excessive.
