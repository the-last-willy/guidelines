# Coding standard

The coding standard is important for collaboration.
The coding standard is an evolving document.

## Formatting

Always write code in the least surprising way.

For formatting, pick one of the most popular ones and stick to it.
It doesn't really matter which one.
Just **stay consistent**.

For C++, the most popular ones would be :
- [LLVM](https://llvm.org/docs/CodingStandards.html)
- [Google](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html)
